# Introduction

This article will be about using genetic algorithm for [Search Race](https://www.codingame.com/multiplayer/optimization/search-race) optimization game. It's not a tutorial for a complete beginner on genetic algorithms. For that I refer to [tutorial](https://tech.io/playgrounds/334/genetic-algorithms/history) and [GA for mars lander](https://www.codingame.com/blog/genetic-algorithm-mars-lander/).




Please refer to the [documentation](https://tech.io/doc) to learn more about adding programming exercises within your contribution.
